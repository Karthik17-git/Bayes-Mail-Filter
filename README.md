Full Project Description

Spam Email Detection Using Naive Bayes

This project is a Python-based spam email classifier that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to detect whether an email is spam or legitimate. It processes email text, extracts important features, and predicts the category with high accuracy.

💡 Why Developed
Email spam remains a major problem, cluttering inboxes and posing phishing risks. Online spam detection tools require internet and may compromise privacy. This offline, Naive Bayes–based system ensures:

Instant classification without internet.

User data privacy by processing emails locally.

Lightweight performance for quick predictions.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Language: Python

Libraries:

scikit-learn – Naive Bayes model & feature extraction

pandas – dataset handling

nltk – text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)

🚀 Features

Offline email spam classification

High accuracy using Naive Bayes

Fast predictions even on large datasets

Works with .csv datasets

Can be extended to live email filtering

📈 Problems It Solves

Removes dependency on online tools

Prevents phishing/spam attacks by early detection

Speeds up classification for bulk emails

Protects privacy by keeping all processing local
